# Data Structures (Purdue ECE368)

This repo accumulates 5 large programming assignments that I completed while I took ECE 36800 (Data Structures).
Throughout the completion of this course, I found great joy in completing these assignments.
They were some of my favorite porgramming assignments in college because they were challenging (20+ hours), they demanded that I think very carefully about time and space complexity, and they allowed me to apply my own creativity and originality.
